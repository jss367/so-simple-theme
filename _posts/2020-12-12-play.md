This contains unusal examples of animals playing. I don't think there's any dog that dogs play similar to the way we do - performing activities with no ultimate "point" other than deriving pleasure from the activity. We've certainly evolved to enjoy play, probably because it acts as practice for future life-saving endeavors, but that's not *why* we play. We play because it is *fun*, not because we're *intentionally* practicing for some future event. So that's what I mean by play here.

So I'm not including videos of dogs chasing balls. Not because it's not play but because it's so commonplace. However, when a cow does the same thing... that's a lot more interesting. And only because it's not something I've seen as much. So, what animals like to play?



## Playing games (this might be a separate section)

FAKE WARNING!!! I believe this one is fake, although I must say it's very good.

Jenga:

This one is much longer... I'll upload the rest at some point. I'm actually not clear how much this is play... is the dog enjoying it? Or is it doing it because it wants to please its owner. I'm not asking if it's been trained - obviously the answer is "yes", but now that the dog knows the game, is it playing it? It's the difference between asking a dog to sit (result of training but not considered playing) and having a dog chase a tennis ball and drop it at the owner's feet (result of training and still considered playing)

## Dog Skateboarding

This is I find more interesting because the dog really leans into the turn to get around that bend. Very impressive work.



## Dog Playing Volleyball

I want this dog.

Maybe I should make a separate section for playing

## Deer Playing with Soccer Ball

It really looks like the deer has watched humans play soccer, somehow learned that the goal is to put the ball in the goal, and that it's appropriate to celebrate afterwards. This is one of those examples where it certainly *looks* like the deer is intentionlly doing exactly what human do, and then _celebrating_ afterwards, but it's not conclusive in my opinion. This is the kind of thing I would like to see lots more examples of. 


## Spectacled bear jumping with child

Is this play? Not really sure.
