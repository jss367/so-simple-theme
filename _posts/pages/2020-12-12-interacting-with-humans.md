This is another post where most of these aren't actually using tools, but I came across too many of these videos that I thought were interesting to ignore. Plus, they're cute.

# Communication

## Cat Sign Language

OK, this one isn't a tool. And it's not technically sign language. But I think think it's an interesting example of communication.

## Dog Soundboard

This one's hard to interpret. Does the dog really understand what the soundboard is saying?

## Bearded Dragon Waving

I like this video but I think the main point is serves as is a cautionary tail. Humans wave their hands as a way to say "hi". Bearded dragons wave their heads to show submission (and bob their heads for dominance). Thus while to a human this might look like a bearded dragon saying "hi", it's far more likely it is indicating submission to the human. It just shows that while we can learn a lot from these videos, we need to be cautious in our assumptions.
