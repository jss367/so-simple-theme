## Dog Turtle Game

Here's one of those situations where it's really hard to know what's going on inside the animal's head. Clearly the dog is playing a game and the turtle's actions are consistent with the game, but is it *playing*? Is the turtle having *fun*? Is that a turtle thing to do? Or is it something like the ball looks like food, and the turtle is trying to eat it (or do something else completely dissimilar to playing) and it just *looks* like playing?

## Funerals

There are lots of birds that are known to hold funerals. Here is the same thing with black vultures.

## Counting

Here's where you have to be very careful of a Clever Hans effect. It would be good to see this same behavior in a lab setting - no human, just a die that rolls itself to a random number then the chicken has to walk some distance away after pecking. However, if you look at this video I *do* think the chicken starts to walk away right after the last peck and isn't picking up a cue from the human.
