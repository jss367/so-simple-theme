## Dog Turtle Game

Here's one of those situations where it's really hard to know what's going on inside the animal's head. Clearly the dog is playing a game and the turtle's actions are consistent with the game, but is it *playing*? Is the turtle having *fun*? Is that a turtle thing to do? Or is it something like the ball looks like food, and the turtle is trying to eat it (or do something else completely dissimilar to playing) and it just *looks* like playing?
