 Bottlenose dolphin, killer whales, Cleaner Wrasses (only fish on the list), Asian Elephant, Eurasian Magpie (first bird, 2008), Pigeon (can be taught to pass), Bonobo, Bornean Orangutan, Chimps, and of course Humans (starting at about 18 months of age). It says there are still other animals like pigs that come incredibly close.

gorillas don't pass the mirror test

monkeys took extra time

Animals *using* the mirror, as in gaining information from their reflection, *is* interesting. Basically, there was food visible in the mirror but hidden from direct view, and the question was could the pig use that  information to get the food. You can [see the same setup in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqD3FkDgGYk). But it's not the same as the mirror test, in which we hope to learn how or of the animal sees themselves in the world.
It certainly means something. In that article the authors state that "To use information from a mirror and find a food bowl, each pig must have observed features of its surroundings, remembered these and its own actions, deduced relationships among observed and remembered features and acted accordingly." These are all interesting things. They're not the same as recognizing oneself, but we're looking at a spectrum of ideas and this doubtlessly helps us put pigs on that spectrum.

There's 

In the article [Pigs learn what a mirror image represents and use it to obtain information](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347209003571?via%3Dihub) they certainly discuss the pig *using* the mirror, but not necessarily recognizing themselves.



Maybe it would be better to use a screen instead and change the color of their features of something like that.

## Chimps

Chimps are known to be able to see themselves in mirrors, and you can see that happening here

Here's another one that much longer, but here's the first 20 seconds:

## Cats

All these seem pretty similar. Most cats seem to either think the mirror is another cat, think it's an open space, or ignore it.

It's not like reflections are a completely new thing with humans. Reflections have been around as long as water has been freezing, and it wouldn't have surprised me had more animals learned to use their reflections.

## Cat Passing?

Most times cats seem to ignore the mirrors. But sometimes they freak out a bit.

The is the closest I've ever seen to a cat passing the mirror test. It's not perfectly conclusive, but very suggestive. I would like to see either more cats do this or 

> Note: This one is 3X

Here's the original link for that one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akE2Sgg8hI8





Some cats might get it. I'm sure some do not. But this shows that at least some cats pass this test, which is incredibly similar to the mirror test.




This is not strictly a mirror, but I think this is some of the most convincing evidence I've seen. The cats clearly know that the *human* is reflected on the screen, so they must know themselves, right? I wish there were filters for the cats that distorted them. If they reacted the same way *that* would be that one last piece of evidence.
This shows that they understand *mirrors*, but it doesn't **explicity** show that they are aware of their existence. It's so close though... they are aware that they are being held by their owner who is reflected in the mirror, holding a cat. Therefore... they are that cat, right? It feels so close to a "yes" but I still wish we could do one more test.

I could see myself passing it.



Chimps usually start out by thinking it's a different chimp, then they figure it out

Chimps pick food out of their teeth, like to look at their mouths.


Orangutans and chimps pass, monkeys do not.


There are lots of problems with the mirror test as an infinite number of Internet commenters like to point out, but I think we miss an opportunity if we fail to realize there's something very interesting and of great scientific value going on here.

It's certainly not a good test to conclusively determine that an animal *isn't* self-aware, but with some results you can say that some *are*, and other times it's inconclusive.



It's always possible that these are fake.


This is currently 4X. I'll break it up separately.

## Ants

Whether ants have ever passed the mirror test remains uncertain in my opinion.

Two researchers from Brussels. In the paper [Are ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) capable of self recognition?](https://www.scinapse.io/papers/2180773430). I can't find any other research that has attempted to reproduce it.

The auther is still an active researcher: https://ebe.ulb.ac.be/ebe/People.html
