This is really more screens/computers, not electronics. For example, turning on AC doesn't go here

## Dog imitating dog on TV

This (and many others) clearly show that the dog recognizes the dog on the TV. This doesn't distinguish between a dog understanding it's a TV (i.e. that the dog it's seeing isn't present) vs a window, but it does show that a dog recognizes another in the absense of smell. This is evidence against the suggestion that some animals (or at least dogs) fail the mirror test because there is no scent of the dog. From visuals alone and no scent this dog is recognizing (and cutely immitating) another dog.
