The mirror test is among the most famous experiments in animal psychology. One can learn a lot simply by observing an animal looking in a mirror. from its It is used to see if animals can recognize themselves when they look in a mirror. What's such a big deal about an animal seeing itself in the mirror? Well, to *see* yourself - that is, to actually recognize that it is *you* in the mirror - you have to be aware that *you* are an entity. *You* are an entity with a body, just like those around you.

This might seem trivial, but I don't think it's necessarily true that many animals are aware. If you interviewed a lizard, would it be able to tell you it's a lizard? My guess is that it could not. Well, lizards don't speak English so we can't interview them directly. But by observing them, I think we get at something fundamental that we would otherwise miss. Despite all of its flaws, I don't know of a better way to get a sense of an animal's mind than watching its behavior. And the most interesting single observation I have seen is observing that behavior in front of a mirror.

Now, there are obvious limitations to this test. The main problem is that while seeing some behaviors in a mirror definitaly show self-aware (e.g. using it to clean their teeth), the inverse is not necessarily true. Animals that do *not* recognize themselves in a mirror are not, necessarily, lacking self-awareness. There are two main limitations to this test that I see:

1. If an animal recognizes themself but doesn't display any behavior that we associate with self-recognition, the mirror test will fail.

2. If an animal is not a particularly visual animals, then it's likely to not work. 

However, I want to push back on these limitations. After watching lots of animals perform this test, I have found that there are relatively distinct groups that behaviors fall into. For those that recognize themselves, we see a lot of self-investigation. And why not. It makes sense that an animal would benefit from a rare chance to view itself. For example, chimpanzees like to look in their mouths and at their teeth. 

I don't really buy the notion that an animal could recognize itself yet still try to play or fight the reflection. To me, it's pretty clear that nothing playing with or fight the reflection is aware that it *is* the reflection.


You could also be self-aware yet not recognize yourself.

there is risk of false negatives here

It was started by Gordon Gallup placing a red dye on chimpanzees. The dye had no scent and could not be felt, so it could only be detected by sight. He placed it above their eye and on their ear - places they couldn't see without using the mirror.

There is a need to be rigorous, but sometimes the effect size is so large that it's obvious what's happening. 

It usually takes animals some time to get used to the mirror. The natural reaction is that it is another animal. So it often takes extended time with the reflection to perform a full test.


having a ‘theory of mind’, which means being
able to infer the states of minds of others

Seeing a reduction in aggressive behavior alone would be significant. Notably, New Caledonian crows always react aggressively. Growing up the was a cardinal that always saw its reflection and would attack it. This behavior continued for a long time, with no indication that it had ever figured out that it was looking at itself.

We must be careful
neither to imbue animals with unknown
cognitive capacities nor to rob them of skills
that they might possess


The youngest chimp I'm aware of to show self-awareness was Megan, at 3 years and 3 months old (Self-Recognition in Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): Distribution,
Ontogeny, and Patterns of Emergence)

There's no doubt that you can still be self-aware and still "fail" a mirror test.

The mirror test is easy to criticize, but as far as tests of self-awareness go, I'm not sure what we've got that's better.


Some animals are not as vision-based as humans, or would only recognize themselves in a modality of senses.

Could we use another sense for the mirror test?
Smell --  too diffuse. They might think that they are the origin, has been done with dogs though... inconclusive results
Taste -- seems unlikely, but could try it
Sound -- I can't even recognize my own voice. My internal voice is  different than external
Touch - I don't know how you would conduct this experiment. You could make an identical cast, but then it wouldn't move.

Why don't more animals use reflections? Bird

I am on the lookout for animals using their reflection from water or ice as a natural mirror, but I haven't seen that yet.


 Bottlenose dolphin, killer whales, Cleaner Wrasses (only fish on the list), Asian Elephant, Eurasian Magpie (first bird, 2008), Pigeon (can be taught to pass), Bonobo, Bornean Orangutan, Chimps, and of course Humans (starting at about 18 months of age). It says there are still other animals like pigs that come incredibly close.

# Terrestrial Mammals

## Cats

Do not pass

### Big Cats

#### Jaguar

#### Puma

<img src='https://github.com/jss367/antools/blob/gh-pages-2.3.4/assets/images/mirrors/puma.gif?raw=true' />

### Domestic Cats

All these seem pretty similar. Most cats seem to either think the mirror is another cat, think it's an open space, or ignore it.

#### Cat Passing?

Most times cats seem to ignore the mirrors. But sometimes they freak out a bit.

The is the closest I've ever seen to a cat passing the mirror test. It's not perfectly conclusive, but very suggestive. I would like to see either more cats do this or 

> Note: This one is 3X

Here's the original link for that one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akE2Sgg8hI8





Some cats might get it. I'm sure some do not. But this shows that at least some cats pass this test, which is incredibly similar to the mirror test.




This is not strictly a mirror, but I think this is some of the most convincing evidence I've seen. The cats clearly know that the *human* is reflected on the screen, so they must know themselves, right? I wish there were filters for the cats that distorted them. If they reacted the same way *that* would be that one last piece of evidence.
This shows that they understand *mirrors*, but it doesn't **explicitly** show that they are aware of their existence. It's so close though... they are aware that they are being held by their owner who is reflected in the mirror, holding a cat. Therefore... they are that cat, right? It feels so close to a "yes" but I still wish we could do one more test.

## Elephants

#### Asiatic elephant

One in 3 has passed as written. However, the others seem to display other characteristics.
It's going to look different in different animals, and sometimes you just know it when you see it. An animal using a mirror to clean its teeth is definitely self-aware, although that certainly shouldn't be a precondition for concluding an animal is self-aware.

## Dog

<img src='https://github.com/jss367/antools/blob/gh-pages-2.3.4/assets/images/mirrors/dog_mirror.gif?raw=true' />

Here's a compilation:

Just because they're *relatively* less visual doesn't mean that their not primarily visual. The other pages document lots of examples of dogs recognizing other dogs without smelling them.

## Pigs

I don't think they pass, although they recognize what a mirror is

## Pandas

Out of 34 tested, none passed


## Primates

#### Humans

Begin passing at around 18 months. Not all humans pass though (many severely autistic people do not)


#### Bonobos

passed

#### Orangutans

passed

#### Chimpanzees

passed

Chimps usually start out by thinking it's a different chimp, then they figure it out

Chimps pick food out of their teeth, like to look at their mouths.


Chimps are known to be able to see themselves in mirrors, and you can see that happening here

Here's another one that much longer, but here are the first 20 seconds:

#### Gorillas

I think the results are inconclusive. Some results have suggested they do not pass, but I think others suggest they do. Many people would say they do not, but I think this video suggests that they do. It only takes one. Gorillas behave very aggressively so are often anesthetized during the experiment. It would be interesting to see what happens with daily exposure to a mirror over a long period of time.

Gorillas are generally considered not to have passed the mirror test. Sometimes they have become violent so are often anesthetized before the test.

I think this one is recognizing himself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cMyBS-87Lk

He's certainly not behaving like it's an intruder. Here's an example of that:

#### Macaques

Three species have been tested, none have passed

#### Baboons

Hamadryas baboons have been tested and not passed.

Based on what I've seen with chimpanzees, I believe the negative result to be significant for baboon. They seem roughly equally visual as chimpanzees (the bright hindquarters suggest this), but do not display any of the same behavior. Maybe these findings *do* point to a lack of self-recognition in baboons.

Here's a baboon:

# Aquatic Animals

## Dolphins

passed

## Orcas

passed

## Cleaner wrasse

The only fish on here. supposedly has passed

Does this make them the youngest?

## Manta rays

Unclear to me. Some claim they have passed


# Birds

## Eurasian magpie

passed

## Grey parrot

has not passed

## New Caledonian crow

Has not passed

Have been tested in front of mirrors though. They were able to use mirrors to find food, but it's not conclusive. The result was statistically significant, but not absolute. It's maybe that they were seeing food in the mirror and searching for food near there, thereby finding the food reflected in the mirror more often, without realizing they were seeing a reflection.

## Pigeons

Seemed to pass with training?

# Cephalopods

## Octopus

Have not passed, although I wonder if we would recognize what it looks like when an octopus does.


The official method is to place a dot on the animal and see if it moves to inspect the dot. That's probably a good approach but it's not the only option. Sometimes the effect is so obvious that we don't need to rely on the dot. For example, this chimpanzee is clearly looking in the mirror and using it to look at its teeth.


monkeys took extra time

Animals *using* the mirror, as in gaining information from their reflection, *is* interesting. Basically, there was food visible in the mirror but hidden from direct view, and the question was could the pig use that information to get the food. You can [see the same setup in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqD3FkDgGYk). But it's not the same as the mirror test, in which we hope to learn how or of the animal sees themselves in the world.
It certainly means something. In that article, the authors state that "To use information from a mirror and find a food bowl, each pig must have observed features of its surroundings, remembered these and its own actions, deduced relationships among observed and remembered features and acted accordingly." These are all interesting things. They're not the same as recognizing oneself, but we're looking at a spectrum of ideas and this doubtlessly helps us put pigs on that spectrum.

There's 

In the article [Pigs learn what a mirror image represents and use it to obtain information](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347209003571?via%3Dihub) they certainly discuss the pig *using* the mirror, but not necessarily recognizing themselves.



Maybe it would be better to use a screen instead and change the color of their features or something like that.

It's not like reflections are a completely new thing with humans. Reflections have been around as long as water has been freezing, and it wouldn't have surprised me had more animals learned to use their reflections.

Orangutans and chimps pass, monkeys do not.


There are lots of problems with the mirror test as an infinite number of Internet commenters like to point out, but I think we miss an opportunity if we fail to realize there's something very interesting and of great scientific value going on here.

It's certainly not a good test to conclusively determine that an animal *isn't* self-aware, but with some results, you can say that some *are*, and other times it's inconclusive.



It's always possible that these are fake.


This is currently 4X. I'll break it up separately.

## Ants

Whether ants have ever passed the mirror test remains uncertain in my opinion.

Two researchers from Brussels. In the paper [Are ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) capable of self recognition?](https://www.scinapse.io/papers/2180773430). I can't find any other research that has attempted to reproduce it.
