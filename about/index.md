Looking for a site that hosts **videos of animals using tools**? Well, you came to the right place! Looking for something else? Then this site is probably not for you.

I’ve always been fascinated by animals. I love spotting foxes and owls in the wild, taking care of cats, dogs, and axolotls as pets, reading about birds solving puzzles, and listening to David Attenborough tell me about exotic animals in faraway places. But most of all, I loved observing animals. I watch them and wonder, “What’s going on inside their brain? What are they thinking? *Are* they thinking?"

Out of all the ways of exploring animal brains, I find watching them using tools to be the most elucidating. What can we say about an animal that can manipulate its environment to achieve a goal versus one that can't? What can we say about intelligence from watching birds pick up sticks to scratch their backs?

Tool usage isn’t the only way to measure animal intelligence. It’s probably not even the best way. I'm not even sure what kind of a tool would be useful to a fruit fly (tiny spears to fend away other males when courting a female?). It's easy to tell that a chimpanzee recognizes himself in a mirror, but would we be able to tell if a turtle did? Would it start checking out how its shell looks from the side? What does it say that a chimpanzee recognizes itself in a mirror but a mountain lion does not? Do you have to have a theory of mind to manipulate other animals? What can we learn from watching animals learn to manipulate human tools? Why does the gorilla react aggressively to the mirror while the chimp sees himself? Why do some cats ignore it while others try to fight or play with it? 

However, it would be foolish and closed-minded to suggest that we can’t learn anything. We need to accept the value of these observations while being aware of their limitations. We know that magpies will drop rocks in water bottles to increase the level of water so they can drink it but many other birds do not. It's reasonable to assume they have the same goals - magpies aren't known for being exceptionally more thirsty than other birds - so we are seeing a cognitive ability in one species that is lacking in another.

As I was pondering these questions, I started saving clips I’d found on the Internet and making notes on them. I would see something interesting on Reddit or Youtube and bookmark it. I found my collection growing and growing until, eventually, I thought I should do something with it all. Thus, animalsusingtools.com was born.

We are in an era where we have new things. If a researcher spends 30 years living with chimps, that’s X days. All over the world, we have that many interactions in X seconds. To be clear, the researcher will learn things about animals that would never be learned in the dispersed fashion, but isn’t it also true that the dispersed fashion could learn things that would otherwise never be detected by the researchers? What if 1 in a million cats could pass the mirror test? Researchers would never be able to capture this. But, what if 10 different videos from 10 different people all showed their cats passing the test. Sure, it would be nice to have these in a scientific environment with double-binds and other fancy stuff like that, but we’re not going to have that. All we need is one example of a cat passing a mirror test to demonstrate that at least one cat can pass the mirror test. That fact alone would be significant.

In fact, I think there are things we could *only* learn by this method. If 1 in 4 cats could pass the mirror test (see the [mirror page](https://animalsusingtools.com/articles/mirrors/) for more details on the mirror test), I would expect scientists to be able to find this. But that's not necessarily true. We've seen varying percentages able to pass the test in a variety of animals. X percent of chimps and Y percent of elephants can. I don't see any reason to think that some animals couldn't be rarer, even much rarer. Maybe one in a million cats can pass? How would we ever find that within the confines of carefully controlled experiments? I don't think we can.


Sometimes it’s easier to convince yourself that something is working. For example, the soundboard videos, in my opinion, are not conclusive. This would definitely be a time for being in a laboratory with the right test. I find in these videos that the humans often respond to everything that dog says as if it’s intentional, but it’s not at all clear to me that it is. This is the kind of thing that would benefit from a controlled experiment. But that’s not true in all cases. You know need to be an expert to conclude, after watching chimpanzees look in the mirror, that they are definitely aware that they are seeing a reflection.


This is a collection of videos (and some pictures) of animals using tools (and other related topics I found interesting) that I’ve collected from the Internet. These are not my videos - I’m simply curating them.


I’m not pretending these are a “random sample”. This isn’t a randomized control trial. In particular, because it’s not random, not controlled, and not a trial. So it fails on all three!

As these are videos from the Internet, they must come with a note of caution. First, I do not research whether these are real or fake. I don’t try to contact the originator, investigate for signs of digital manipulation, etc. If I see something that leads me to believe a video is fake I won’t include it or will at least mention that. But I’m no expert at detecting fake videos so be aware.

I don’t do anything to determine their authenticity; I just grab them from wherever I see them online
Possibly, some of these clips are fake. In general, I think the vast majority are real, but others could disagree. I’m also going off of lots of videos, not just one.

Enjoy!


But I think there is a lot we can learn from these videos.
And while some are funny, or cute, or warm your heart, they are also interesting. 

And as much time as I -or anyone - can spend with animals, there’s still a plethora of clips online that people have recorded of animals using tools. Someone finds their cat reacting to its reflection in the mirror and makes a funny video. 
I think we can learn a lot from this world.
All of a sudden, we are in a world where everyone has a camera at the ready and there are billions of interactions.
There are billions of people in the world, having billions of interactions with billions of animals, capturable on billions of cameras and smartphones. Let learn something from all of this.

Yes, I am learning things about animal cognition from high schoolers’ 
TikTok videos that I didn’t from reading scientific papers. The preponderance of evidence is significant. If everyone filmed their cat walking in front of the mirror and the most interesting or funny were posted, that’s an incredible dataset. The funny ones are usually the most enlightening.
I think the chance of a grand conspiracy of people making animals appear to be using tools seems far-fetched to me.
Ranging from a grand conspiracy of teenagers (I’m nominating “grand conspiracy” to refer to a group of teenagers) who kick their kicks from fooling nerds who collect videos of animals to people manipulating photos to get more likes.
